# Todo App Vue
Just a very simple example of Webpack + Vue.js + SASS + Materialize with a little bit of axios and lodash. May serve as nice starting point for something bigger.

# Build 
1. Install dependencies<br />
`npm i`

2. Run in development mode<br />
`npm run dev`

3. Run for production<br />
`npm run build`

4. Installing this can be really useful, especially on Windows to quickly delete node_modules:
```bash
npm i -g rimraf
rimraf node_modules
```

# Task Api
This app uses task api from [here](https://github.com/abik11/todo-app-server).
